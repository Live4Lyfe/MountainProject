Crack climbing is a type of rock climbing in which the climber follows a crack in the rock and uses specialized climbing techniques. The sizes of cracks vary from 

those that are just barely wide enough for the fingers to fit inside, to those that are so wide that the entire body can fit inside with all limbs outstretched. 
Finger cracks are just wide enough for all or part of the finger to fit inside.  Off-finger cracks, also called "off-hand", are wider than finger cracks.  Hand 
cracks are just large enough for the entire hand to fit inside.  Off-width cracks are wider than hand cracks, but not wide enough for the legs or upper body to fit 
inside.
 Chimney cracks are large enough to fit the entire body inside, allowing for a wide variety of techniques depending on the distance between the two rock faces. 


Crack climbing requires techniques like finger jams, finger locks, hand jams, foot jams, fist jams, liebacks, laybacks, thumb stacks, thumb cams.  Footwork is 

important for crack climbing, and many of the hand jams can be used similarly with feet inside the cracks. 

Cracks split rock faces and are sometimes called splitters.  Most cracks take gear, like nuts, friends, cams, stoppers, and hexes.  Nuts, stoppers, and hexes are 
passive gear, while cams and stoppers are active.
