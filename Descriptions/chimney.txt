Chimneys are cracks wide enough for you to fit your body in.  Chimneys range in width from body-width chimneys, which are just wide enough for you to squeeze into, to
wide gaping chimneys that you climb by bridging and stemming your arms and legs on opposite walls. The two basic kinds of chimneys aresqueeze chimneys and full-body
chimneys.  Small chimneys are similar to off-width cracks.

Chimneys are similar to dihedrals because they require stem techniques.  Stemming uses opposing pressure on both sides of the chimney to create friction and make
vertical progress.  Your body fits inside a squeeze chimney. If the chimney is a tight fit, then progress is made by inches. Wider squeeze chimneys allow you to
slither upward inside it. The basic technique to climb a squeeze chimney is the secure heel-toe movement also used in off-width.On wider chimneys, keep both feet on
the opposite  wall and move by pushing against the wall behind your back with your hands.
