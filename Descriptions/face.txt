Face climbing is a type of climbing where climbers use features and irregularities in the rock such as finger pockets and edges to ascend a vertical rock face.[1] Face climbing is contrasted with crack climbing. Face climbing is less reliant upon technique than crack climbing, but instead relies more upon body position.[2]
Holds can be used in a variety of ways by your feet and hands as you move up the rock 
The mantel is a specific use of down-pressure technique. Pushing down with your hands you allow your feet to reach the same hold your hands are on. [3]
Stemming is a counterforce technique where you support yourself between two spots by pressing in opposite directions. [3]
A hold that requires your fingers to face upwards instead of downwards. [4] Your arms will pull while your feet push.
