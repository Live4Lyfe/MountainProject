Slab is a technical type of rock climbing where the rock face is at an angle less than vertical and is often blank. Slab is characterized by blank rock,balance and
friction dependent moves on very small holds. Slab is often not leadable, or climbable from the ground up, unless it has pre-drilled bolts to protect the climb,
making most slab either top rope climbing or sport climbing. Special techniques such as smearing are necessary to climb blank slab routes. Slab is a type of face
climbing. Static moves are common on low-angle, ramps, and slabs.

Techniques
Slab is a very technically demanding styles of climbing. Slab demands intense concentration and precise foot placement.  Technique is very
important because it is hard to muscle through slab routes.  Static moves are common on low-angle, ramps, and slabs.

Smearing
A central technique used on slab walls is smearing: placing a foot directly on smooth rock where no feature exists. Pressure is applied and friction between
the shoe and the rock allows upward movement on the wall. Smearing performance depends on a climber's shoe and rock type. Sticky rubber shoes increase
friction. Smooth rock, such as quartzite, is difficult to smear on, while sandstone or granite is much easier. The angle of the slab also plays a large part in
the difficulty of the move. A 60 degree slab is easier to smear on than an 80 degree slab. A good smear also puts as much shoe in contact with the rock as possible.
 The foot should be kept flat, instead of using just the points of the toes to smear. Use the friction between your shoes and the rock to hold you in place. Get as
much weight onto your foot as possible. Look for tiny edges, ripples and other dimples in the rock. The smallest wrinkles can be an excellent place to smear your foot
and make some upward progress

Body placement
Climbers must keep their center of gravity directly above their feet in slab climbing. A climber that keeps their weight too close to the wall risks pushing their
feet off the wall. This means a climber will often have their hips away from the rock, which is the opposite of traditional climbing technique. A climber’s hands
are often used to assist in this positioning by pushing out against the wall.  The more technical a route, the more body placement matters.

Movement
Slab requires smooth, technical movement over the rock, instead of long, jerky moves. Short steps should be taken to maintain balance, and the arms should be kept
in contact with the rock.  Slab moves are usually static.

Balance
Moving well on slab routes requires stepping up. Usually the moves aren’t physically taxing but require intense balance. Place your foot on a hold and commit to the
process, shifting your weight over and then onto your foot quickly.  Balance is required for slab when hand holds are bad or non-existant. There are special techniques
for balancy moves and slab climbing.

The top techniques for slab climbing are balance, smear and step up. Technical slab routes are hard.

Other words for slab are low-angle, and ramp.  Ramps are generally short, while low-angle slab routes can be any length.  Low-angle routes bring the risk of
cheese-gratering (cheese gratering).  To cheese grater - or cheese-grater - is to slide down a slab, ramp, or low-angle climb while leading.
